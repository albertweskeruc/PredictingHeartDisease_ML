# PredictingHeartDisease_ML
Python Machine learning models to obtain the highest accuracy to predict heart diseases/failures programmed in Google Colab and the file in the repo can be read and uploaded on google colab. 

Heart related diseases have been the leading cause of death worldwide that has resulted in the loss of millions in each every year to this common type of disease. There are three sets of datasets with different sets of  attributes that are able to be used as indicators that a machine learning model can utilize to predict a possible heart disease in a patient. The need for creating machine learning models to predict possible heart diseases in patients with the highest possible accuracy so medical care facilities have the ability of early detection of heart disease in a patient to be able to begin managing and caring for the patient’s disease as early as possible in order to increase the odds of their survival. 
The three datasets we utilized in order to create machine learning models to learn and predict heart related issues through different sets of similar attributes related to determining heart issues. 



Discussion of results

The best accuracy results achieved on Dataset 1 was an accuracy of 89% with dense models using standardized dataset and using kfold. 

The best accuracy results achieved on Dataset 2 was an accuracy of 88.5% with standardized products of attributes with SVC models. 

The Best accuracy results achieved on Dataset 3 was an accuracy of  80% with normalized attributes with SVC models. 



Conclusions

What greatly improved all accuracies  and mse in all three datasets were the utilization of k-fold cross validation, using products of attributes, and standardizing the entire benefit to help combat the influence of attribute’s varying values. By being able to experience k-folds' time consuming learning and validation process in action, we were able to learn why we always utilized train and test set validation over k-fold with the type of datasets we were utilizing throughout the semester. K-fold was an acceptable validation option in all 3 cases of the datasets due to their size.
